Examples of learning how to do Test Automation in WebdriverIO

Most examples require node.js. The folders in the exercise folders do not include node_modules. For each exercise folder that has a package.json in it, you will have to execute 'npm install' or 'npm i' (no quotes) in your terminal, at the folder location which has a package.json file in it.

To run the WebdriverIO tests, use your terminal to find the folder that has the file "wdio.conf.js" for the tests you wan to run. Then execute the command 'npm run wdio' (no quotes) in your terminal.
