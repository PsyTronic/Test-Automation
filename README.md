Examples of learning how to do Test Automation in WebdriverIO

Most examples require node.js. The folders in the exercise folders do not include node_modules. For each exercise folder that has a package.json in it, you will have to run 'npm install' or 'npm i' (no quotes) in the folder which has a package.json in it. Then to run the tests, in that same folder you ran 'npm i', run the command 'npm run wdio' (no quotes).
